# Introduction #

MusicXML is a music interchange format designed for notation, analysis, retrieval,
and performance applications.
It is open for use by anyone under a royalty-free license.
For more information, see at <a href='http://www.makemusic.com/musicxml'>MusicXML web site</a>

The MusicXML library is a portable C++ library designed close to the MusicXML format and
intended to facilitate MusicXML support.

The library provides conversion from/to memory representation of the MusicXML format. Since the format is primarily designed for interchange, conversions to other music representation formats are going along with the library: the <a href='http://guidolib.sf.net'>GUIDO</a> music notation format is supported and corresponding conversion tools included in the library.
